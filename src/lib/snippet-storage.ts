// This file would typically use the useLocalStorage hook if it were a component/hook itself.
// For direct utility functions (if needed outside React components), direct localStorage access is shown,
// but it's generally better to manage this state through hooks in components.
// For this application, we'll primarily use the useLocalStorage hook directly in components.

// Placeholder - actual logic will be within components using useLocalStorage.
// This file can be used for type definitions or constants related to snippet storage if needed.
