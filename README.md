## 🚀 What is CodeBricks AI?

**CodeBricks AI** is an intelligent, block-based coding assistant that helps developers build, understand, and enhance code using AI "bricks". Each brick represents a functional unit — such as **code generation**, **bug fixing**, **explanation**, or **optimization** — powered by state-of-the-art AI models like **Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, and more.

Whether you're a beginner or a pro, CodeBricks makes coding feel like play — with productivity and precision baked in.
